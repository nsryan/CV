Curriculum Vitae : Nathan Ryan
----------------------------------

This repository contains my curriculum vitae source files.

A current pdf can usually be found on my website :

nsryan.github.io/nryan_cv.pdf

In order to build my cv from the source, try latex or pdflatex.

Thanks for your interest.
This is forked from Katy Huff's repo and largely unaltered.

Also, thanks to the individuals responsible for the resume.cls file utilized
here and to Ted Pavlic whose bibenum code I borrowed from the interwebs.
